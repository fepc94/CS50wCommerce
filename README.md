## Project3

Project1

This is my implemantation of Project2 - Commerce - from CS50 Web Programming course.

Commerce is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

The technologies used in this project are Django for the backend, SQLite for the database, HTML for the structure, and CSS for styling.

The following  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1PCmRFC-A4) provides a demonstration of the project's functionality and highlights the required specifications.
